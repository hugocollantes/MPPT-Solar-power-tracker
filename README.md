# MPPT-Solar-power-tracker

**Intelligent Maximum Power Point Tracking System for Photovoltaic Panels**  
Designed with Arduino, Hall-effect current sensing, and real-time PWM control.

This project implements a hardware-efficient MPPT algorithm to maximize energy extraction from a solar cell (SYP-505V5W, 5 V / 5 W), using a current sensor with offset correction and dynamic load modulation through a MOSFET (IRLZ44N).
